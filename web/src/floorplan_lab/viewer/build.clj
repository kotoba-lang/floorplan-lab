  "JVM-side static page build: generates `public/index.html` via
  `kotoba-ui.core/->page` (SSR) -- same `build.clj`-writes-`index.html`
  pattern `kami-app-sculpt`/`kami-app-bim-editor` use, but built on the
  kotoba-ui design-system stack instead of a hand-rolled page fn, per the
  `kotoba-uiux` skill contract (apps require `kotoba-ui.core` only, no raw
  hex/px in app code, layout from `kotoba-ui.shell`). The WebGPU canvas
  itself is the one place this page needs a sizing rule kotoba-ui's shell
  doesn't provide (full-bleed viewport) -- that's added as small,
  unlayered app CSS (`app-css` below), which is exactly what the
  kotoba-uiux 'app CSS always wins, don't fight specificity' rule expects,
  not a rule violation.

  Run via `clojure -M:build` from `web/` -- writes `public/index.html`,
  which `shadow-cljs release app` (see `shadow-cljs.edn`) then joins with
  the compiled `public/js/app.js` bundle. Both are checked into git (same
  convention as the kami-app-* siblings) so `ios/` can bundle `public/` as
  a static resource without a build step at Xcode time."
